# Vines - Personal Website (React + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

This is a ready-to-run React project scaffold for a personal website (built for Vines).
It uses Tailwind CSS for utility styling and Framer Motion for subtle animations.

## Quick setup (locally)
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

> Tailwind requires PostCSS setup included in this project. After `npm install`, the dev server should work.
